# Home Page Content Plan

## Primary Goal
The home page should help users do two things immediately:
1. Connect or disconnect wallet
2. Go to Dashboard

---

## Hero Section (Top)
### Headline
**Own your student data. Grant access with consent.**

### Subheadline
Studentia lets students control who can view which data groups, with wallet-based identity and on-chain consent tracking.

### Primary Actions (most important)
- **Connect Wallet / Disconnect Wallet** (dynamic button)
- **Go to Dashboard**

### Optional Secondary Action
- View how it works

---

## What Should Also Be on the Homepage

### 1) Wallet Status Card
Show small live status so user knows current state:
- Wallet connected/disconnected
- Short wallet address (if connected)
- Active network (LocalNet/TestNet/MainNet)
- App ID (optional)

### 2) “How it Works” (3 steps)
Keep this very short:
1. Connect wallet
2. Set consent by data group and requester group
3. Manage requests and documents in dashboard

### 3) Key Value Props (3 bullets)
- Granular consent by data category
- Request-group based access control
- On-chain consent verification

### 4) Quick Access Tiles
Small cards linking to dashboard modules:
- Consent Controls
- Access Requests
- Documents
- Transactions (optional)

### 5) Trust / Security Note
One short section:
- Your consent state is auditable
- You can revoke access anytime
- Student remains in control of data sharing

### 6) Minimal Footer
- Docs link
- API status (optional)
- Network/environment badge

---

## Suggested Homepage Information Architecture
1. Hero + primary actions
2. Wallet status
3. How it works
4. Value props
5. Quick access tiles
6. Trust note
7. Footer

---

## MVP Version (Keep It Simple)
If you want a minimal first version, include only:
- Hero
- Connect/Disconnect Wallet button
- Go to Dashboard button
- Wallet status text
- 3-step “How it works”

---

## Copy Snippets You Can Use Directly

### Wallet Button Label Rules
- Not connected: **Connect Wallet**
- Connected: **Disconnect / Switch Wallet**

### Dashboard CTA
- **Go to Dashboard**

### Helper Text
- Connect your wallet to start managing consent and access.
- Continue to dashboard to manage requests, documents, and permissions.
